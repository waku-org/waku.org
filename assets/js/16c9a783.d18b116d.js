Waku uses GossipSub for message routing and Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN) for spam protection. GossipSub ensures fast and reliable peer-to-peer message delivery in a permissionless environment, while RLN enforces a common publishing rate limit using zero-knowledge proofs. This paper presents a practical evaluation of message propagation latency in Waku. First, we estimate latencies analytically, building a simple mathematical model for latency under varying conditions. Second, we run a large-scale single-host simulation with 1000 nodes. Third, we set up a multi-host Waku deployment using five nodes in different locations across the world. Finally, we compare our analytical estimations to the results of the simulation and the real-world measurement. The experimental results are in line with our theoretical model. Under realistic assumptions, medium sized messages (25 KB) are delivered within 1 second. We conclude that Waku can achieve satisfactory latency for typical use cases, such as decentralized messengers, while providing scalability and anonymity.",(0,s.jsx)(t.br,{}),(0,s.jsx)(t.br,{}),"Find the full program for conference here: https://dlt2024.di.unito.it/program/",(0,s.jsx)(t.br,{}),(0,s.jsx)(t.br,{}),"Have any questions about the event our tech?
